# Overview
  After the project defense of the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Foundation, the Fireproof Microcapsules Project of our team (Chen Tianao, Li Xingxiang, Yin Yanbin, Zhu Yuewei, Kang Peng and Li Chen) was successfully approved and was supported by the foundation for research of 47000 yuan.
# Progress Report
  The team agreed that although fireproof microcapsules have taken shape, there are still many key problems to be solved. The two biggest problems are the large particle size of microcapsules (usually about 100 microns) and the unknown flame retardancy of shell materials. In addition, there is no specific plan on how to integrate fireproof microcapsules into a complete fire-retardant product to prevent lithium battery from thermal runaway.
  
  To sum up, our team plans to overcome the process problems before the mid-term inspection of the project, and the goal is to stably produce fireproof microcapsules with a particle size of no more than 10 microns.
